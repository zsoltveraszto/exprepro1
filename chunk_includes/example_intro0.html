<p class="ex1">
In this experiment you are going to see dialogues between Anne and Bob, who are discussing pictures. Each picture shows a number of colored shapes. There are three possible shapes:
</p>
<table class='center'>
<tr>
<td align="center"><i>Square</b></i></td>
<td align="center"><i>Circle</b></i></td>
<td align="center"><i>Triangle</b></i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><div class='sx'></div></td>
<td align="center"><div class='cb'></div></td>
<td align="center"><div class='ty'></div></td>
</tr></table>

<p>
However, only Bob can see the pictures, so Anne is always asking him about what he sees.
</p>
<p>
In the experiment you will first see a dialogue between Anne and Bob. Specifically you will see the answer Bob gave, and your task will be to guess what Anne’s question may have been. You will have to type in the question. 
</p>
<p>
Following the dialogue, you will see the picture Anne and Bob were talking about. Your task will be to decide whether Bob’s answer was correct, given Anne’s question and the picture you see. You will indicate this by pressing the 0 for TRUE or 1 for FALSE.
</p>
<p>
We are interested in your spontaneous responses, so don’t think too long before answering.
</p>
<p>
The experiment begins with a few practice trials to familiarize you with the tasks. The practice trials are not about shapes.</p>
